# Intended Purpose and Disclaimer

The Terraform configs provided in this repository can be used to quickly set up
an AWS VPC in `us-east-1`, with one public and one private subnet in each
availability zone.

The contents of this repository are primarily intended to be for learning
purposes.

These configs almost certainly are not appropriate for all use cases, and while
anyone is free to copy and use these (see `LICENSE`), be warned that I am just a
guy and that I do not really know what I am doing.
